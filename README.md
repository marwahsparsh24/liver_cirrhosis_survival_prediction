# Liver Cirrhosis Survival Prediction - Multiclass Analysis

##Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify survival outcomes for patients with liver cirrhosis. The analysis involves preprocessing clinical data, applying machine learning algorithms, and evaluating their performance to provide insights into patient prognosis.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of liver cirrhosis datasets.
- Implementation of various multiclass classification models.
- Performance metrics and visualizations for model evaluation.
- Interpretation of results to guide potential clinical decision-making.

## Installation

Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed. Install required packages using:

```bash Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash Copy code
jupyter notebook liver-cirrhosis-survival-prediction-multiclass.ipynb
```

- Run the notebook cells in order to replicate the analysis.
- Customize the code and models as needed for further research or datasets.

## Data

This analysis uses clinical datasets containing patient features relevant to liver cirrhosis. Ensure data availability with columns like patient demographics, lab results, and health indicators.

## Output
- Model training logs and performance scores (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves for in-depth evaluation.
- Recommendations based on model results to improve healthcare strategies.
